# Enhancement of Permanently Shadowed Regions of the Moon 


The project aims to build a Image enhancement framework utilizing both Dual Illumination Estimation and Cyclic-GAN to enhance the permanentky shadowed regions of the moon. 

The motivation behind it is to enhance the PSR regions so as to help in mission planning of Lunar Expedition Missions. 

*PSR Enahacement details and results.pdf* is a comprehensive report on the methodolgy and tools used to address this problem statement. 

Thank you to ISRO Data Archieve for the dataset of the PSR regions of the moon acquired by the Chandrayan 2 Mission. 

All the references are mentioned in the above mentioned pdf file, and than you to the community that helped me develop this.
